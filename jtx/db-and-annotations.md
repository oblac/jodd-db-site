# Db and Annotations

_JTX_ supports multiple resource types, but its most efficient with single resource type, such as relational database. Therefore, there is whole layer build on top of generic _JTX_ classes that serves just to simplify use and usage of transaction over databases.

### Declarative transactions

But that is not all. Transactions, in general, are a perfect example of scattered logic, that can be encapsulated via aspects. With help of _Proxetta_, _JTX_ can be applied on methods that are annotated with `@Transaction` annotation.

#### Custom transactions

In most applications we would have only two types of transactions: one that only read and one that allows writing data. `@Transaction` annotation by default matches read-only transactions, meaning that on every place where read-write transaction is needed, user have to write this with annotation elements.

To reduce this boilerplate code, it is possible to define custom annotation that takes different default values.
