# Relations & Hints

We have already seen how to use _hints_ to inject values into resulting objects. Lets analyze this topic more and see how to deal with the **one-to-one** and **one-to-many** relations efficiently.

### Problem

Here is the real-life problem. Lets say that we have a list of some telecommunication centers in database. Each center has one or more associated prefixes. Also, each center belongs to one country (i.e. region). We need to fetch all telecom data, as they do not change during the application runtime.

### Model

Model is no-brainer.

```java
    @DbTable
    public class Telecom extends Entity {
        @DbId
        private long telecomId;
        @DbColumn
        private String name;
        @DbColumn
        private long countryId;
        ...
    }
```

```java
    @DbTable
    public class TelecomPrefix extends Entity {
        @DbId
        protected long prefix;
        @DbColumn
        protected long telecomId;
        ...
    }
```

```java
    @DbTable
    public class Country extends Entity {
        @DbId
        long countryId;
        @DbColumn
        String name;
        ...
    }
```

The rest of fields just hold various entity data. All methods are POJO setters and getters. Model objects, for now, are independent.

Note that each model object extends `Entity` class. This is not mandatory, but is considered as a good practice. `Entity` class usually contains implementation of `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods, based on the **primary key** of the class. Again, this is also not mandatory and some would consider the whole instance state then just primary keys. This is fine; using just primary keys is somewhat more pragmatic - and faster - if code is written with having that in mind.

### Lazy approach

Lazy approach is fetching data without joins, firing several database queries. In our example we would need to execute the following queries:

* fetch all `Telecom`s.
* For each `Telecom`, fetch list of its `TelecomPrefix`
* For each `Telecom`, fetch the belonging `Country`.

There is nothing special to mention here, each query and _DbOom_ usage is simple.

### Entity relationships

Up to now, there was no dependencies between entities. Obviously, it make sense to have list of `TelecomPrefix`es inside of `Telecom`, as well as the single `Country`. Therefore, we can write something like this:

```java
    @DbTable
    public class Telecom extends Entity {
        ...
        protected TelecomPrefix[] prefixes;
        protected Country country;
        // get/set methods for above fields
        ...
    }
```

Instead of an array of `TelecomPrefix`es, we could use any `Collection`. {: .attn}

In the lazy approach, the whole _wiring_ would be done manually, by developer. Once when he get list of `TelecomPrefix` entities for some `Telecom` he would need to manually convert it to an array and set it to target.

### Join

This is nice case when we can use a _join_ of three tables to fetch all data in one call. So the code may look like this:

```java
    DbOomQuery q = query(sql(
            "select $C{t.*}, $C{tp.*}, $C{c.*} " +
            "from $T{Telecom t} join $T{TelecomPrefix tp} using ($.telecomId) " +
            "join $T{Country c} using ($.countryId)"));

    telecoms = q.list(Telecom.class, TelecomPrefix.class, Country.class);
```

Here we create join of three tables. Each result set row is mapped to an object array with three elements: telecom, telecom prefix and country. And finally, each such object array is stored in resulting list.

On the first sight, there are no improvements here: for each row, we still need to manually wire results.

### Hints

Hints to the rescue! As we explained, _hints_ defines how to wire objects within the single row. We want to use hints to inject e.g. `Country` instance into the `Telecom` instance, in the single row. Here is how to do so:

```java
    DbOomQuery q = query(sql(
            "select $C{t.*}, $C{t.prefixes:tp.*}, $C{t.country:c.*} " +
            "from $T{Telecom t} join $T{TelecomPrefix tp} using ($.telecomId) " +
            "join $T{Country c} using ($.countryId)"));

    telecoms = q.list(Telecom.class, TelecomPrefix.class, Country.class);
```

The change is small, yet powerful! With hints we instruct to append all `TelecomPrefix` into the `Telecom.prefixes` property, as well to inject `Country` into the `Telecom.country`! Resulting list elements would have just **one** element, a `Telecom`, since all other mapped elements are injected into this instance.

While this perfectly works with **one-to-one** relationships, like with `Country`; there is a failure with **one-to-many** relationships, like with `TelecomPrefix`. This is because for the each row of result set, _DbOom_ will create a **new** instance of `Telecome`. Hence, if a telecom contain two prefixes, it will be listed twice and each time telecom will link just one, different, telecom prefix!

### Cache entities

Fortunately, the problem is easy to solve: by enabling caching on query level (i.e. on result-set level). So this code:

```java
    DbOomQuery q = query(sql(
            "select $C{t.*}, $C{t.prefixes:tp.*}, $C{t.country:c.*} " +
            "from $T{Telecom t} join $T{TelecomPrefix tp} using ($.telecomId) " +
            "join $T{Country c} using ($.countryId)"));

    q.cacheEntities(true);
    telecoms = q.list(Telecom.class, TelecomPrefix.class, Country.class);
```

_DbOoom_ now caches **all entities** during the execution of a query and re-uses existing instances if already exist! In our case this means that instead of creating several instances of `Telecom` for each its prefix, there will be just one instance, with many prefixes injected into it.

Using query cache increases memory usage. {: .attn}

There is just one thing to be aware of - the resulting list will still contain duplicated records (hey, it's the same with Hibernate:) The trivial way to fix this is to use a `Set` instead of `List`\\:

```java
    DbOomQuery q = query(sql(
            "select $C{t.*}, $C{t.prefixes:tp.*}, $C{t.country:c.*} " +
            "from $T{Telecom t} join $T{TelecomPrefix tp} using ($.telecomId) " +
            "join $T{Country c} using ($.countryId)"));

    q.cacheEntities(true);
    telecoms = q.listSet(Telecom.class, TelecomPrefix.class, Country.class);
```

What we have now is the set of unique entities, properly injected with related content.

### EntityAware mode

But using `Set` is not always an option. Can we have a `List`, but **without** duplicate entries? Sure! `DbOomQuery` supports so called "entity mode". It goes one step further from `cacheEntities`, so enabling the entity mode will also enable cached entities.

In entity aware mode, not only that objects are cached, but also they are compared to the previous result! The very same example from above:

```java
    DbOomQuery q = query(sql(
            "select $C{t.*}, $C{t.prefixes:tp.*}, $C{t.country:c.*} " +
            "from $T{Telecom t} join $T{TelecomPrefix tp} using ($.telecomId) " +
            "join $T{Country c} using ($.countryId)"));

    q.entityAwareMode(true);
    telecoms = q.list(Telecom.class, TelecomPrefix.class, Country.class);
```

will now return `List` **without** the duplicates! Just a nice object tree, ready to be used :)
