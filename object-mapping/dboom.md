# DbOom

Up to now, _DbOom_ was used as a convenient replacement for JDBC. _DbOom_ has much more to offer!

The goal behind _DbOom_ is _not_ to have an ORM tool - there are plenty solutions like that out there. Instead, _DbOom_ is a thin Object-Mapping layer. Relations are not pre-defined, but defined when actually used: before the query execution; or not defined at all and set manually. Moreover, there is _no_ generic QL language that works across databases; instead you use the full power of native SQL of specific database that is in use. That does not mean that you can't address _entities_ in your queries! With _DbOom_ you can use entity names and properties, and they will be converted into the database tables and columns.

### DbOom per database

_DbOom_ works with as many databases as you need. Since using a single relational database is a common for projects \(at least for projects that uses _Jodd_ :\) - _DbOom_ considers this as a special case and offers many helpful shortcuts for his single-database usage \(more later\).

The central place in _DbOom_ is... a `DbOom` instance \(who would guess :\). You will have one instance per database. `DbOom` recognizes the single-database usage, making available various shortcuts; mainly preventing you to carry on the instance of `DbOom`.

`DbOom` offers fluent builder to construct itself.

```java
    DbOom dbOom = DbOom.create().get();
    dbOom.connect();
```

or:

```java
    DbOom.create()
        .withSessionProvider(mySessionProvier)
        .withConnectionProvider(connectionPool)
        .get()
        .connect();
```

Once connected to database, `DbOom` detects the database vendor and applies some default naming convention.

### DbOom components

`DbOom` provides access to following components:

* `DbOomConfig` - configuration, mainly naming conventions,
* `DbQueryConfig` - query-related configuration,
* `DbEntityManager` - manager of entity mappings,
* `DbSessionProvider` - session provider,
* `ConnectionProvider` - connection provider
* `QueryMap` - map of named queries.

### DbOom factories

`DbOom` also is a factory for all _DbOom_ working tools:

* `entities()` - returns `DbEntitySql` factory,
* `sql()` - creates new `DbSqlBuilder`,
* `query()` - creates new `DbOomQuery()`.

In single-database mode, most of these can be used without referencing `DbOom`. {: .attn}

The following pages describes all _DbOom_ components and tools assuming the single-database mode; for the sake of simplicity.

### Single-database mode

As said, having a single database is a special use case for `DbOom`. Once when created, the instance of `DbOom` can be accessed using the following:

```java
    DbOom dbOom = DbOom.get();
```

The `get()` method will throw exception if multiple databases are in use, or none.

Furthermore, all _DbOom_ working tools \(classes that are used for quering, mapping etc\) have a constructor with `DbOom` as an argument. In single-database mode, you can use static constructor methods, that does not take `DbOom` instance. For example, this usage:

```java
    DbOomQuery q = new DbOomQuery(dbOom, dbSession, "select * from ...");
```

can be replaced with:

```java
    DbOomQuery q = DbOomQuery.query(dbSession, "select * from ...");
```

Finally, you can use the `DbOom` instance directly instead, no matter which mode is in use:

```java
    dbOom.query("select * from ...");
```

The following documentation will assume the single-database mode, just for the sake of simplicity.
